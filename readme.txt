= Installing Gravity Forms and Add-Ons =

The above commands all require Gravity Forms to be installed. However, if Gravity Forms is not installed then you can use this add-on to install it along with all the other official Gravity Forms add-ons.

The install command will download and install the latest version Gravity Forms available for auto-update and then run the database setup. The license key will be saved in the plugin settings.

A valid license key is required either in the `GF_LICENSE_KEY` constant or the `--key` option.

Examples:

* `wp gf install --key=xxxxx`
* `wp gf install --key=xxxxx --activate`
* `wp gf install gravityformspolls --key=xxxxx`
* `wp gf install gravityformsquiz --key=xxxxx`

Once installed, the database can be set up or upgraded separately using the setup command. The command will not re-run the setup unless the `--force` flag is set.

Examples:

* `wp gf setup`
* `wp gf setup --force`

Gravity Forms and official add-ons can be updated using the update command.

Examples:

* `wp gf update`
* `wp gf update gravityformspolls`


Check the current version using the version command.

Examples:

* `wp gf version`
* `wp gf version gravityformspolls`
