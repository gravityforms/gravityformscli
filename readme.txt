= Installing Gravity Forms and Add-Ons =

The above commands all require Gravity Forms to be installed. However, if Gravity Forms is not installed then you can use this add-on to install it along with all the other official Gravity Forms add-ons.

The install command will download and install the latest version Gravity Forms available for auto-update and then run the database setup. The license key will be saved in the plugin settings.

A valid license key is required either in the GF_LICENSE_KEY constant or the --key option.

Examples:

* wp gf install -key=xxxxx
* wp gf install -key=xxxxx --activate
* wp gf install gravityformspolls -key=xxxxx
* wp gf install gravityformsquiz -key=xxxxx

Once installed, the database can be set up or upgraded separately using the setup command. The command will not re-run the setup unless the --force flag is set.

Examples:

* wp gf setup
* wp gf setup --force

Gravity Forms and official add-ons can be updated using the update command.

Examples:

* wp gf update
* wp gf update gravityformspolls


Check the current version using the version command.

Examples:

* wp gf version
* wp gf version gravityformspolls
